# Java & Serverless Functions & Scaleway

A simple example to run Java Serverless Functions on top of Scaleway Serverless Containers

I wrote this Java example to complement the [existing examples](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples) on the [serverless-scaleway-functions plugin](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions).

The example is strongly inspired by this [Flask project written in Python](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-scaleway-functions/tree/master/examples/container) with PORT definition by Environment variable.
